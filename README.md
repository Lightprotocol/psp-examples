# PSP Examples

Collection of custom PSPs (Private Solana Programs) built on top of [Light Protocol v3](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/light-protocol).

These are reference implementations for Solana Localnet.

Each PSP is bootstrapped with the [Light CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lightprotocol/cli) and uses Light's [zk.js](https://npmjs.com/package/@lightprotocol/zk.js) on the client. 

We'll add more examples over time and keep these up2date with latest changes.

For an example using zk.js just for token transfers without a custom PSP, see [./private-payments](https://github.com/Lightprotocol/psp-examples/tree/main/private-payments)
